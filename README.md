# AirBnB price prediction in USA

## Why is this an intersting project?
* Pricing is one of the most important decisions that hosts need to make to gain profits.
* The prediction exercise here provides a method to predict prices for properties around the same area with similar conditions.
* It will give the hosts a better idea of the propertyâ€™s market values.
* Airbnb can retain hosts, expand its business, and eventually increase revenues.

## Methodology
* Data preprocessing: Drop missing data and remove outliers
* Exploratoy Data Analysis:
  * Create histograms and correlation matrix for numeric features
  * Visualize listings and prices distributions across states
* Data Modeling:
  * Use linear regression, XGBoost and multivariate adaptive regression splines to predict prices
  * Compare the model performances by RMSE, MAE and R2 Score

## Outcomes
* Price is most positively correlated with host listings count and availabilty in the year. 
* So, more listing a host has, the price is higher and if the place is more available, you can charge more!

Looks like renting an entire appartment is more attractive over other options!

## Conclusion

* Predicted prices with three models: linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and XGBoost.
* XGBoost has the best performance with the highest R square and lowest RMSE and MAE.
* Room types and city are the key predictors.
